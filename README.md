What is Bash?
What is the primary function of a shell in a computer’s operating system? A shell is the way you communicate with the operating system.
How does Bash locate and execute commands on a Linux or Unix system? By looking up the commands in certain directories and if that command is there then bash runs the command.
How can you determine if your system is running a Bash shell? By using the echo command and then the name
What makes Bash scripting powerful and why is it considered scriptable? Because anything that you can put into plain text bash can run it and scripting it you can then execute commands while multitasking.
Bash scripting allows for customization, automation, and efficiency. Discuss methods or practices from your previous work experience or cultural background that aim to achieve similar goals in daily tasks. From my previous work experience there were multiple scripts on the server that did a lot so that I didn’t as such as sunday backups and daily backups. It also looked for down devices in the field. So that way I didn’t have to go searching through all the devices.
